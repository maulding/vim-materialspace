# material-girl.vim
Vim colors file based on Google's Material design color scheme.

**Currently this is only working for gVim.** I do not use the console version of vim so it may be a while before that part is added to the script.

Inspired by Silvestre Herrera's [Atom syntax](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-syntax).
